CakeProject
===========

Forget `cake bake`! `git clone` FTW!

Status
===========
Still have a few TODOs to do before master becomes stable

Goal
===========
I'd like to be able to clone an entire project, run a script to initialize it, and then start coding. A lot of this can be done as part of `cake bake`, however,
having it as a git repo makes it a bit more portable and skips a few steps in my process for creating and maintaining a CakePHP project.


TODO
===========
1. add script to change certain config settings
1. ~~add auto environment switching solution for config files ( still looking for a good one )~~ Made my own https://github.com/angelxmoreno/CakePHP-Environment-Switcher
2. ~~Integrate with FOC Crud plugin~~
3. add console tasks to change salt and sipher seed
4. explore adding to composer
5. setup composer to use plugins
6. add vagrant file
7. add various session mngt plugins
8. add various caching mngt plugins
